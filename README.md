# CardGame

created using tutorial found here:
https://docs.replit.com/tutorials/python/build-card-game-pygame

I'm using this project as a means to figure out git and GitHub. I still need to link this to my IDE and try running the program.

I will use this structure to build other card games in the future. I'm thinking a solitaire game for the missus.

I am typing this is vscode :)
